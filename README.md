# Face Recognition Application

## Introduction
This project is a face recognition application that leverages machine learning to identify and verify individuals from images. The application is designed to be used for various purposes such as security, authentication, and personal identification.

## Features
- Face detection and alignment
- Feature extraction using deep learning models
- Face recognition and verification
- Supports multiple image formats

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/yesenvidnath/FaceRecognito-PythonFacialRecognitionApplication.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. If using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd /content/drive/MyDrive/face_recognito
    ```

2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python face_recognition.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image and perform face recognition.
